#### What is the goal?

A fast Matrix homeserver that's easy to set up and just works. You can install
it on a mini-computer like the Raspberry Pi to host Matrix for your family,
friends or company.

#### Can I try it out?

Yes! Just open a Matrix client (<https://app.element.io> or Element Android for
example) and register on the `https://conduit.koesters.xyz` homeserver.

#### How can I deploy my own?

##### Deploy

Download or compile a conduit binary and call it from somewhere like a systemd script. [Read
more](DEPLOY.md)

##### Deploy using Docker

Pull and run the docker image with

``` bash
docker pull matrixconduit/matrix-conduit:latest
docker run -d -p 8448:8000 -v db:/srv/conduit/.local/share/conduit matrixconduit/matrix-conduit:latest
```

Or build and run it with docker or docker-compose. [Read more](docker/README.md)

#### What is it build on?

- [Ruma](https://www.ruma.io): Useful structures for endpoint requests and
  responses that can be (de)serialized
- [Sled](https://github.com/spacejam/sled): A simple (key, value) database with
  good performance
- [Rocket](https://rocket.rs): A flexible web framework

#### What are the biggest things still missing?

- Appservices (Bridges and Bots)
- Most federation features (invites, e2ee)
- Push notifications on mobile
- Notification settings
- Lots of testing
